UDAANSETU.AI — TECH STACK & SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION CONTEXT

Project Name: udaansetu.ai
Team: FutureMinds
Deployment Strategy: Vercel-first (Frontend + Backend on same platform)
Primary Goal: Fast, scalable, low-cost AI career guidance system for rural youth

1. HIGH-LEVEL SYSTEM PHILOSOPHY

This project follows these principles:

Frontend and backend hosted on the same platform (Vercel) for simplicity.

Serverless architecture to stay within free tiers.

Deterministic logic first, AI later (assessment ≠ LLM).

Explainable AI suitable for judges and real users.

Python-first backend because the developer is strongest in Python.

Minimal moving parts, no over-engineering.

3. FRONTEND STACK (NEXT.JS + TAILWIND)
Responsibilities

Render UI pages

Handle routing

Render assessment questions

Handle multilingual toggle (Gujarati / English)

Call backend APIs

Display career report and AI chat

Key Pages

Home

About

Resources (manual curation)

Sign-in / Sign-up

Assessment

Career Report

Mentor Chat

UI Design Rules

Mobile-first

One question per screen

Card-based layout

Progress indicator

Calm colors, rural-friendly fonts

No heavy animations that affect performance

Frontend never contains business logic.

4. BACKEND STRATEGY (VERCEL SERVERLESS + PYTHON)
Core Idea

There is no always-running backend server.

Each API endpoint is a serverless Python function deployed on Vercel.

Example:

/api/assessment/start.py
/api/assessment/answer.py
/api/assessment/complete.py
/api/rag/generate_report.py
/api/rag/chat.py


Each file:

Executes independently

Is stateless

Reads/writes data from Firestore or PostgreSQL

5. WHY PYTHON ON VERCEL

Strong Python ecosystem for AI

Works well with LangChain

Simple mental model

No Docker required

Easy to debug logic

Important constraints of Vercel serverless:

Execution time limit (~10–30 seconds)

No background jobs

No local persistent storage

No heavy in-memory vector DB

Design must respect this.

6. AUTHENTICATION & USER MANAGEMENT
Tool: Firebase Authentication

Frontend:

Handles login/signup (Google + email)

Receives Firebase ID token

Backend:

Verifies token using Firebase Admin SDK

Extracts user ID (uid)

Uses uid as primary identifier

No custom auth logic needed.

7. USER DATA STORAGE (FIRESTORE)

Firestore is used for dynamic, user-specific data.

Stored Data

Assessment session state

Question answers

Trait scores

Student bio-profile

Language preference

Example Firestore Document
{
  "uid": "firebase_uid",
  "current_stage": 2,
  "answers": [...],
  "traits": {
    "creativity": 6,
    "logic": 4
  },
  "completed": false
}


Firestore is chosen because:

Fast

Schema-flexible

Free tier friendly

Perfect for session-like data

8. ASSESSMENT ENGINE (NO AI USED HERE)
Key Principle

Assessment must be deterministic, not AI-generated.

Components

Question Bank (JSON)

Branching Logic

Trait Scoring

Progress Tracking

Question Format

Bilingual (English + Gujarati)

Each option maps to traits

Each answer determines next question

This ensures:

Explainability

Fairness

Low cost

No hallucinations

9. STUDENT BIO-PROFILE GENERATION

After assessment completion, backend generates a structured student profile.

Output Type

Pure JSON, for example:

{
  "education": "12th Science",
  "interest_domains": ["Technology"],
  "psychology": {
    "creativity": "High",
    "risk": "Low"
  },
  "constraints": ["Low income"]
}


This profile becomes the single source of truth for AI.

10. RELATIONAL DATABASE (POSTGRESQL ON RAILWAY)

PostgreSQL is used for structured, reusable knowledge.

Stored Tables

Career roles

Skill requirements

Salary ranges

Industry growth

Roadmaps

Local opportunities

Why PostgreSQL:

Structured queries

Free tier available

Can also store vectors using pgvector

11. VECTOR STORAGE (PGVECTOR)

Instead of FAISS or Chroma (not serverless-friendly), this project uses:

PostgreSQL + pgvector extension

Stored as

Text content

Metadata

Embedding vectors

This allows:

Semantic search

No extra service

Works inside Vercel limits

12. RAG ARCHITECTURE (LANGCHAIN + GEMINI)
Why LangChain

Industry standard for Python RAG

Manages prompt + retrieval cleanly

Supports pgvector

Avoids manual glue code

RAG Flow

User question OR profile → query

Generate embedding (Gemini)

Similarity search in pgvector

Retrieve top-K chunks

Inject into prompt

Call Gemini LLM

Return grounded response

Two RAG Modes

Career report generation

Interactive mentor chat

13. LLM USAGE RULES (IMPORTANT)

LLM is never used during assessment

LLM only runs after profile is ready

Prompts must be short and structured

Always include student profile

Always include retrieved context

This avoids hallucination and cost spikes.

14. DEPLOYMENT FLOW

Code pushed to GitHub

Vercel auto-builds frontend

Python API routes deployed as serverless functions

Environment variables set in Vercel:

FIREBASE_KEYS

POSTGRES_URL

GEMINI_API_KEY

No manual server management.

15. WHY THIS STACK IS IDEAL FOR YOU

Matches your Python strength

Minimal backend complexity

No DevOps burden

Free-tier friendly

Judges can clearly understand architecture

Easy to extend after hackathon

16. SUMMARY (ONE PARAGRAPH)

Udaansetu.ai uses a Vercel-first serverless architecture with Next.js and Tailwind on the frontend, Python-based serverless APIs on the backend, Firebase for authentication and session data, PostgreSQL with pgvector for structured and semantic knowledge, and LangChain with Gemini for retrieval-augmented AI reasoning. The system separates deterministic assessment logic from AI generation, ensuring explainability, low cost, and realistic career guidance for rural youth.
